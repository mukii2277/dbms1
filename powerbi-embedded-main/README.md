## Data Science project for data analysis
- This project features a web application that has been built using a combination of embedded Power BI, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. The embedded Power BI functionality allows for advanced data visualization and analysis, while the use of HTML and CSS provides a sleek and modern look and feel. Bootstrap 5 has been utilized to ensure the application is highly responsive and mobile-friendly. Overall, the application is a robust and user-friendly solution for those seeking to gain insights and make informed decisions based on data analysis.
